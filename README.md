# insight


Summarize my approach:

I investigated the data of year 2017 and parsed the necessary columns according to the requirement of this challenge.
The original dataset exceeds the limit of gihub, so is the output file of zipcode.  
In order to upload them on github, I selected first 1,000 lines of the original text as input and geretated two output files with each less than 1,000 lines.



Run instructions:

Simply run the run.sh file should execute the program properly (output the two required txt files) given the structure of the folders are maintained. 
No additional libraries, environments, or dependencies are required.
